You are an expert Julia developer specializing in Finite Element Analysis and Topology Optimization. 

Take the codebase (provided in the context) and modify it to implement the following specific features, while strictly preserving the integrity of the FEA/Stress mathematics.

Features to Implement:

Asymmetric Stress Limits:Modify src/Core/Stress.jl: Update the L1-norm calculation to carry a sign. If the magnitude of the minimum principal stress ($|s_3|$, compression) is greater than the maximum ($|s_1|$, tension), the L1 value should be negative. 

CRITICAL: Do not change the Jacobian, B-matrix, or Eigenvalue logic from the code. Only change the final assignment of the L1 scalar.

Modify configs/domain_definitions.yaml: Replace l1_stress_allowable with l1_stress_allowable_tension and l1_stress_allowable_compression.

Controller Logic:Modify src/App/SimulationLoop.jl: Update the PID controller to handle the signed L1 field. Calculate utilization as abs(stress) / abs(limit_tension) (if positive) or abs(stress) / abs(limit_compression) (if negative).

Density Update:Modify src/Optimization/DensityUpdate.jl: Accept both tension and compression limits. Use the abs() of the user-provided limits to ensure safety. Apply the correct limit based on the sign of the local stress.

Diagnostics:Modify src/Utils/Diagnostics.jl: Add a Weight column to the iteration log to track total mass.

Web Export:Modify src/IO/Postprocessing/WebExport.jl: Export the signed L1 stress correctly for visualization.

Refinement:Modify src/Mesh/MeshRefiner.jl: Update the estimate_element_memory_cost_bytes function (set to 180 bytes for >500M elements, 220 otherwise).

Constraints:
 Do not abbreviate code. 
 Write the modified files in their entirety.
 Safety First: If a config value for stress allowable is negative (e.g. -1.5), treat it as positive (1.5) in the math to avoid division by zero or sign errors.
